            <p>I decided to research my group's question regarding the ethical and legal dangers of AI and how the government should apply regulations to certain AI generators. I found that the EU is pushing an AI act in order to place some regulations on artificial intelligence. First, they plan on banning specific AI's that pose a threat to the people, some of which include: cognitive manipulation of vulnerable groups, social scoring (essentially ranking people based on socio-economic status, behavior, or personal characteristics), and similar harmful categories. They also placed a safety regulation on high risk applications, such as to cars, aviation, and medical devices that may impact people's health.</p>

            <p>There is also talk of a copyright law, which will require people to disclose when generative AI was used. Content that is generated by AI, such as deepfakes (which was my main concern when creating my group's question), must be clearly labeled that it is AI generated.</p>

            <p>This act has been adopted by the Parliament in March of 2024, and was approved by the council in May. Similarly, the US has created a blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights that protects against similar violations, prioritizing data privacy, discriminatory practices, and requiring notices when AI is in use. However, the blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is simply a white paper, and therefore is not legally binding. It was published way back in 2022, and there has yet been any notable advancement in creating a bill that is actually legally binding, which indicates the government's failure to keep up with AI's rapid advancement over the past two years.</p>

            <p>It seems as though there is a consensus as to what regulations should be applied to AI generated content. All that is left is for there to be actual laws placed into effect, as there are still a lot of fake content being produced without any disclaimers.</p>
