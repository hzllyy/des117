            <p>The article on semantic HTML was a great summary of the importance of HTML, as well as a good reference for the different semantic HTML tags. Through clarifying the content of a page using semantic tags, we as designers are able to organize the information on a webpage so that it is accessible to everyone.</p>

            <p>In the recent article I wrote and styled, I made use of many different semantic tags. In particular, I used the "figure" tag for the first time. It allowed me to set apart my image elements, as I was able to use the tag "figcaption" to separate the image captions from the normal text of the article. Other useful semantic tags that I used included "blockquote", "nav", and "section". Because my article was so long, having these semantic tags helped tremendously with my organization.</p>

            <p>Because the topic of my article was on Peter Paul’s Ruben’s painting Samson and Delilah, I wanted the styling to reflect the subject matter. I chose a neutral palette, as I felt that was well suited for an art history piece, and ensured that my text was easily legible, as there was a lot of text for the reader to get through. I found that the most challenging part of visual design is choosing the best color palette, as it is difficult for me to choose color combinations that are harmonious.</p>
