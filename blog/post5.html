            <p>This course has taught me so much in the span of just 6 short weeks. As someone who has had coding experience in the past, I found HTML and CSS one of the more satisfying languages to learn. Many people in my life who mainly dealt with back-end code always said that front-end was easy, but after this course, I am disinclined to agree--it is true that HTML and CSS have a shallow learning curve, but there is much complexity in the sheer amount of information to be absorbed, as well as the mental gymnastics required for its application.</p>

            <p>I especially appreciated the video "Why is CSS is So Weird?", as it really put into perspective why CSS is made the way it is. The importance of CSS as an adaptable medium is a defining characteristic, and we as designers shouldn't see it as a handicap. This video made me appreciate the efforts of the first web developpers to ensure web sustainability, as it is thanks to them that we are still able to access older content.</p>

            <p>The article I chose to read is called <em>User Research is Storytelling</em> by Gerry Duffy, who explains the process of User Research through the lens of a standard story's structure. Duffy stresses the importance of user research's involvement in web and app development, which really helped expand my understanding of the many processes that go into the development of user interfaces.</p>

            <p>Overall, this course and all the content I consumed as a part of this course has really helped me better grasp the field of web development and UI/UX, and further cultivated my growing interest in it.</p>
