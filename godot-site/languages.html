        <p>When it comes to coding a game, one of the most necessary skills would obviously be understanding coding languages. The Godot engine is able to understand two coding languages; C# or GDScript.</p>

        <p>C# is a language developped by Microsoft that runs on the .NET framework. It is a very popular language for game development, as it is a cross-platform language that is great for object-oriented programming. It is also very similar to languages like JavaScript, Java, and C++, so if you are familiar with any of those languages, C# may be the right choice for you.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, GDScript is a scripting language made specifically for the Godot game engine. Its syntax is extremely similar to Python's, and since I have more experience coding games using Python, this will be my language of choice.</p>

        <p>There are resources all over the internet to help with your understanding of both languages. C# can be used for other game engines, like Unity, and may be worth learning if you want a language that is applicable in a broader sense. However, I would like to note that GDScript is definitely more beginner friendly, as it is a lot simpler and easy to learn.</p>
